# Sanitation for OpenAPI specification

This document records the sanitation done on top of the official OpenAPI specification from Ballerina HubSpot CRM Engagement Notes Connector. 
The OpenAPI specification is obtained from [HubSpot](https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-public-api-spec-collection/blob/main/PublicApiSpecs/CRM/Notes/Rollouts/424/v3/notes.json).
These changes are done in order to improve the overall usability, and as workarounds for some known language limitations.

1. **Change the `url` property of the `servers` object**:
   - **Original**: `https://api.hubapi.com`
   - **Updated**: `https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/notes`
   - **Reason**: The original URL is too generic and does not provide a clear indication of the API endpoint. The new URL improves the consistency and usability of the APIs.

2. **Update API Paths**:
    -  **Original**: Paths included redundant prefixes in each endpoint. (e.g., `/crm/v3/objects`)
    -  **Updated**: Paths are modified to remove the redundant prefixes from the endpoints, as it is now included in the base URL.
    For example:
        - **Original**: `/crm/v3/objects/notes/batch/read`
        - **Updated**: `/batch/read`
    - **Reason**: This modification simplifies the API paths, making them shorter and more readable.

## OpenAPI cli command

The following command was used to generate the Ballerina client from the OpenAPI specification. The command should be executed from the repository root directory.

```bash
bal openapi -i docs/spec/openapi.json --mode client  --license docs/license.txt -o ballerina
```
Note: The license year is hardcoded to 2025, change if necessary.
